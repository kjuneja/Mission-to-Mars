# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is polish Robin's web app. She wanted to add the Images of Mar's hemispheres online and wants the site to be scraping-friendly. She wants to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scrapped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of web app to accommodate these images. 

This project consists of three technical analyses. We will submit the following deliverables:

* Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
* Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
* Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
